The combination of word guessing from Wordle with Math to create equation guessing

Project Title: Equatio

Project Description:

Equatio is a Wordle-inspired game that challenges players to find the correct mathematical equation used to obtain the target whole number stated in the website. 

This game was inspired from a YouTube tutorial on how to make a clone of the Wordle game. The programmers explored how to change guessing words into guessing equations by reading and trying out what they learned from the Internet. 

It encompasses various integers ranging from -10 to 250. Its operations include EMDAS: Exponents (**), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Addition (+), and Subtraction (-). Besides these, we also added Modulo (%), which is an operator known in some programming languages. These integers and operators are enclosed in a calculator inspired format, seen at the right side of the game.

It is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML served as the starter language since the programmers linked the CSS and JavaScript file to the HTML file. CSS was crucial for most of the design that the website encompasses. JavaScript  on the other hand did most of the technical process from being able to press the integer and operation buttons to evaluating the condition of the player’s guesses. The programmers decided on making the guessing portion 7 columns and 7 rows for more chances of winning. Beside the 7 columns are two more columns consisting of an equal sign and the evaluated answer for the equation they guessed, making it a total of 9 columns and 7 rows.   

The programmers also tried to plug in some features like being able to see the player’s high score (winning with lesser guesses). Moreover, they also tried showing how many tries and wins the player has experienced, as well as choosing the difficulty mode they want to try. 

All in all, it is an interactive game that exercises a player's brain by thinking of the correct generated solution for the given answer (a.k.a. the target number). All in all, this is a great concept to try not just for players but also for beginner programmers who want to take on a more challenging path.
